# Canonical Documents

This project defines a small set of **canonical documents**. These are the
normative sources for implementation and review.

## Canonical (v1 / Prod‑v0)
- `math-v1.md` — formal specification (Profile A)
- `architecture.md` — system architecture and boundaries
- `interface.md` — external interface contract
- `phase_f_implementation_spec.md` — implementation plan with acceptance tests

## Non‑Canonical / Draft
- `math.md` — superseded by `math-v1.md`
- `math-delta.md` — working delta notes

## Rule
If a non‑canonical document conflicts with a canonical one, **canonical wins**.
