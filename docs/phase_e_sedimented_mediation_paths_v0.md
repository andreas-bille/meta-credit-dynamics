## 1. Motivation

Phase E extends the analysis of failure and repair (Phase D) toward the
conditions under which *non-trivial emergence* can occur in learning systems.

Rather than asking how systems recover from breakdown,
Phase E asks what *remains* after breakdowns,
and how these remnants shape future system development.

The central hypothesis of this phase is that
emergence requires neither explicit memory nor semantic planning,
but rather **irreversible structural residues**
left by prior mediation processes.

## 2. The Sandbox as an Epistemic Device

The "sandbox" is not a toy environment,
but a deliberately constrained and observable world.

Its defining properties are:

- global observability
- controlled incompleteness
- irreversible consequences
- absence of semantic shortcuts

The sandbox excludes explanations by scale or opacity.
If structure emerges, it must do so
because the conditions allow it — not because it is hidden.

---

## 3. External Inhibition

Learning systems tend toward triviality
when all constraints are internal or optimizable.

**External inhibition** denotes constraints that are:

- imposed from outside the system
- non-adaptive
- non-negotiable
- not representable within the system state

Examples include:
- hard resource limits
- irreversible costs
- blind spots in perception
- path-dependent exclusion of options

External inhibition does not guide behavior;
it shapes the *space of possible behavior*.

## 4. Sedimented Mediation Paths

### 4.1 Definition

**Sedimented Mediation Paths (SMPs)** are the residual structural effects
left behind by broker or mediation paths that have lost their operational role.

A mediation path may:
- compete
- learn
- allocate resources
- eventually fail or exhaust itself

When this happens, the path ceases to operate
but leaves behind irreversible modifications to the system’s topology.

These modifications are called *sediment*.

### 4.2 What Sediment Is Not

Sediment is:

- not memory
- not a replay buffer
- not a learned parameter
- not semantically interpretable

Sediment has no access interface.
It does not “know” that it exists.

Removing sediment would require resetting the world,
not the agent.

---

### 4.3 Functional Properties of Sediment

Sediment manifests as:

- altered transition costs
- asymmetric reachability
- selective permeability of paths
- local stiffness in the state space

Sediment is passive, but not neutral.
It channels future growth without prescribing it.

---

## 5. Rebirth of the Stack

Without sediment, system rebirth is trivial:

- collapse
- restart
- full symmetry restored

With sediment, rebirth becomes **controlled growth**:

- early-stage dynamics are canalized
- some paths are effectively discouraged
- others become structurally favored

Sediment provides **topography**, not a plan.

The reborn stack does not inherit strategies,
but grows within a shaped possibility space.

---

## 6. Emergence Without Semantics

Non-trivial emergence requires at least:

1. Irreversibility  
2. Asymmetric cost structures  
3. Path dependence without memory  

Sediment satisfies all three conditions.

Meaning arises not from symbols,
but from the impossibility of undoing certain histories.

---

## 7. Relation to Phase D – Reparaturforensik

Phase D asked:

> What failed, and why?

Phase E asks:

> What remains, and how does it constrain the future?

Reparaturforensik reconstructs past dynamics.
Sediment explains future limitation.

Together, they describe a full life cycle:
from dynamic mediation
to structural residue
to guided rebirth.

---

## 8. Open Questions

This concept paper deliberately leaves open:

- minimal formalization of sediment
- precise rebirth triggers
- decay or accumulation dynamics of sediment
- interaction between multiple sediment layers

These are not gaps,
but entry points for Phase E implementation.

---

## 9. Summary

Phase E proposes that emergence does not require intelligence,
intention, or memory.

It requires a world that remembers
by refusing to forget.

Sedimented Mediation Paths are the mechanism
by which failure becomes structure
and history becomes constraint.

This is the minimal condition
for emergence that is neither trivial nor scripted.
