# Phase F – Production Readiness

## Curriculum, Training, Freeze, and Proof of Deployability

**Project Context:** GAP / Economy of Neurons  
**Status:** Concept Paper (Public Draft)  
**Phase:** F – Production Readiness  
**Scope:** Conceptual framing and production criteria  
**Preceding Phase:** Phase E – Sedimented Mediation Paths  

> Phase F marks the transition from *conceptual soundness* to *operational proof*.
> It does not introduce new learning principles.
> It demonstrates that the existing model can be trained, frozen, and deployed
> reliably in non-trivial environments.

## 1. Motivation

Phase E established that learning through irreversible exclusion
(Sedimented Mediation Paths) is coherent, implementable, and stable.

However, conceptual coherence alone does not imply deployability.

Phase F therefore asks a narrower, more demanding question:

> **Can this system be trained deliberately, efficiently, and repeatably
> to a stable operational state in non-trivial worlds?**

Production readiness is not defined by optimality,
but by *trainability*, *freeze-ability*, and *predictable behavior under use*.

---

## 2. What Production Readiness Means (Here)

Phase F deliberately adopts a conservative definition of production readiness.

A system is considered production-ready if:

1. A **curriculum** can be explicitly defined without embedding domain semantics.
2. Training converges in **bounded time and compute**.
3. Learning can be **frozen** without loss of stability.
4. The frozen system behaves **reliably under environmental variation**.
5. Performance is **competitive relative to humans or classical control**,
   not globally optimal.

No claim is made about:

* general intelligence,
* creativity,
* autonomy,
* or universal optimality.

---

## 3. Curriculum as the Central Artifact

### 3.1 Curriculum, Not Reward Engineering

In Phase F, learning is driven by **curricula**, not reward shaping.

A curriculum is defined as a sequence of environmental phases,
characterized solely by:

* world configuration,
* constraints and hazards,
* observability limits,
* rebirth and selection policies.

Curricula specify *conditions*, not *solutions*.

### 3.2 World-Agnostic Design

Curricula are independent of the underlying world adapter
(MazeWorld, BinomialWorld, DrivingWorld, enterprise decision spaces, etc.).

The system is never told:

* what actions mean,
* what success “should” look like,
* or which concepts are important.

Only survival, mediation stability, and cashflow determine persistence.

---

## 4. Training Dynamics in Phase F

Training proceeds as controlled exposure to increasingly constrained worlds.

Key characteristics:

* Learning occurs through **broker survival and death**.
* Failed mediation structures become **Sediment**.
* Sediment restricts future formation implicitly.
* Rebirth resets behavior, not history.

Training ends when:

* sediment growth stabilizes,
* rebirth frequency declines,
* and operational behavior remains consistent across episodes.

---

## 5. Freeze and Inference

### 5.1 Freeze Semantics

Freezing the system means:

* no new brokers are spawned,
* no new sediment is formed,
* no rebirth occurs,
* only existing mediation structures operate.

Freeze is a **policy decision**, not a model limitation.

### 5.2 Inference Mode

In inference mode, the system:

* executes without exploration,
* does not optimize further,
* and relies entirely on the sediment-shaped topology.

Stability, not adaptivity, is the goal.

---

## 6. Evaluation Criteria

Phase F evaluates systems along production-relevant axes:

* time to stable operation,
* number of rebirth cycles,
* sediment growth rate and saturation,
* behavioral variance after freeze,
* robustness under environmental drift.

Absolute reward maximization is explicitly *not* a success criterion.

---

## 7. Relation to Other Paradigms

### 7.1 Relation to Reinforcement Learning (RL)

RL focuses on reward maximization through exploration.

Phase F differs fundamentally:

* exploration is constrained by irreversible exclusion,
* failed structures cannot reappear,
* optimization occurs only within a pruned space.

RL may be used *after* exclusion, but is not required.

---

### 7.2 Relation to Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs)

PGMs rely on:

* semantically defined variables,
* fixed ontologies,
* and probabilistic inference.

The Phase F system instead:

* treats all variables as expendable brokers,
* requires no semantic grounding,
* and forms history through survival and death.

PGMs do not produce sediment; this system does.

---

### 7.3 Relation to Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs learn from static data and remain perpetually reversible.

They:

* cannot form irreversible history,
* cannot exclude structures permanently,
* and cannot freeze learning meaningfully.

Phase F addresses a different class of problems:
operational systems that must *stop learning*.

---

## 8. Scope and Non-Goals

Phase F explicitly does *not* aim to:

* achieve human-level intelligence,
* replace semantic modeling,
* discover novel goals,
* or explain decisions internally.

Its purpose is narrower:

> **To prove that exclusion-based learning can be trained, frozen,
> and deployed reliably.**

---

## 9. Summary

Phase F is not an exploratory phase.
It is a verification phase.

It demonstrates that:

* curricula can be defined without semantics,
* learning converges under controlled exposure,
* history can be frozen without collapse,
* and the resulting system is operationally usable.

If Phase F succeeds,
the model transitions from a conceptual framework
into a deployable engineering approach.

No stronger claim is required.
